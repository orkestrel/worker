 * A runtime type predicate used to narrow a wire payload with no assertion.

 * AGENTS §14) but is re-declared here so the server workers surface is self-describing
 * and the worker-side `serve.ts` — which may not import from `@src/core` (it loads as
 * raw `.ts` inside a spawned thread) — shares the same vocabulary. A `Guard` NEVER
 * throws; adversarial input returns `false`. It is the zero-`as` bridge across the
 * structured-clone boundary: the main side narrows each reply value through the
 * `result` guard and the input through the `input` guard, so a generic `TInput` /
 * `TResult` is reconstructed by validation rather than asserted.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The type a value is narrowed to when the predicate holds

 * impl file holds only its class / functions). A reply is a discriminated union on `ok`: a
 * `true` carries any opaque `value` (narrowed at the boundary by the `result` {@link Guard},
 * with no `as`); a `false` carries a string `error`. The worker-side `serve.ts` cannot import
 * this (it loads as raw source in a spawned thread, AGENTS §5 exception) and posts the same
 * shape structurally. The `id` ties a reply to its job, so a stray / foreign-id message is

/**
 * A live worker thread plus its latched liveness state — the pooled resource a
 * {@link createNodeWorker} leases per job.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `alive` starts `true` and flips to `false` the moment the thread `error`s, `exit`s, or
 * is evicted on abort; the pool's `validate` reads `alive && worker.threadId > 0`, so a
 * dead thread is destroyed and replaced rather than reused. `death` LATCHES the first
 * terminal event (`error`'s `Error`, or a synthesized one on `exit`) — the death-signal
 * record a `dispatch` checks at entry, so a job dispatched AFTER the thread died (its
 * death events already fired and will never fire again) rejects immediately instead of
 * awaiting events that already happened. Under event-loop pressure Node delivers a dead
 * thread's `online` + `error` + `exit` in ONE synchronous exit-drain batch, starving the
 * microtask chain that attaches the dispatch listeners until after every death event —
 * the latch is what makes that ordering safe. `worker` is the underlying
 * `node:worker_threads` thread (its `postMessage` / `terminate` drive the protocol).

/**
 * Options for `createNodeWorker` — a CPU-parallel worker over `node:worker_threads`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `script` — the worker module each pooled thread runs; its module must call
 *   `serveWorker(...)`. A `.ts` script requires Node ≥ 23.6 (native type-stripping); on
 *   older Node point this at a built `.js` / `.mjs`.
 * - `input` — narrows the work payload BEFORE it crosses the structured-clone boundary
 *   (fail-fast) and supplies the `TInput` inference, so call sites need no type argument.
 * - `result` — narrows every reply value coming back from a thread; an invalid reply
 *   rejects the job. This is the zero-`as` type bridge — `TResult` is inferred from it.
 * - `workerData` — opaque data cloned to every thread once at spawn (read there via
 *   `serveWorker`'s host `workerData`); must be structured-cloneable.
 * - `concurrency` — the maximum jobs in flight at once; the thread pool's `max` matches
 *   it, so at most this many threads exist. Defaults to `1`. Floored at `1`.
 * - `retries` — the default extra attempts per job on failure / timeout; defaults to `0`.
 * - `timeout` — the default per-attempt deadline in milliseconds; defaults to none.
 * - `store` — durable backing for outstanding jobs (survives a restart; `restore()`
 *   re-runs them).
 *
 * @typeParam TInput - The work payload each job carries (inferred from `input`)
 * @typeParam TResult - The value a thread resolves for a job (inferred from `result`)
